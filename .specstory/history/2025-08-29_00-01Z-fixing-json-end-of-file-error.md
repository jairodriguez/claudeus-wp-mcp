# Fixing JSON end of file error (2025-08-29 00:01Z)

_**User**_

still I'm getting the following error in my code:

**Problem in /Users/bernardojrodriguez/.claude.json:**
- **Type:** Error
- **Line 1181:** End of file expected.
- **Code:** N/A
- **Source:** json

Can you help me understand and fix this issue?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a JSON syntax error in their `.claude.json` file. The error message says "End of file expected" at line 1181, which suggests there's extra content after what should be the end of the JSON file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see the issue now. Looking at the structure, it seems like the JSON might have an extra closing brace somewhere before line 1182. Let me check a bit more context above to understand the structure better. The issue might be that there's a missing opening brace or an extra closing brace somewhere above.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the structure more clearly. Looking at the pattern:


## Examining Configuration Structure
- Found a closing brace `},` at line 1154, indicating the end of a server configuration.
- At line 1155, a new server configuration begins with `"@21st-dev/magic": {`, suggesting a shift to a new setup.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The issue is that the JSON parser is encountering extra data after what it considers to be the end of a valid JSON object.
